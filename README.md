# 7eventy7/unraid-templates

This repository contains XML template(s) for the self hosted apps that I develop. 
All my apps are and will forever be completely open source and MIT liscensed. 

## Requirements
- All XML files must be in the `main` branch
- 2FA Authentication must be enabled on this repository
- Templates must have appropriate categories set

## Support & Issues
All support and issues must be handled through GitHub Issues. This centralizes my development process and makes it easier to:

- Track bug reports
- Manage feature requests
- Document solutions
- Maintain version control

Please do NOT reach out through other channels - create an issue on the Github project page instead
